- What is CSS:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for designing and formatting the layout and appearance of web pages. It works in tandem with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to control the presentation, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page.

- How to add style to an element:
There are three ways to add styles to an element using CSS:

a. Inline styles: Add the 'style' attribute directly to the HTML element.

html
```
<p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
``` 

b. Internal styles: Include a <style> block within the <head> section of the HTML document.

html
```
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

c. External styles: Create a separate CSS file (e.g., 'styles.css') and link it to your HTML document using the <link> tag within the <head> section.

html
```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

- What is a class:
A class in CSS is a reusable identifier that can be applied to multiple HTML elements to apply the same styles. Classes are defined with a period (.) followed by the class name in the CSS file.

css
```
.my-class {
  color: blue;
}
```

In your HTML file, you can apply the class using the 'class' attribute.

html
```
<p class="my-class">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
```

- What is a selector:
A selector in CSS is a pattern that is used to select specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. Selectors can be based on element types (e.g., 'p'), classes (e.g., '.my-class'), IDs (e.g., '#my-id'), attributes (e.g., '[href]'), and more.

- How to compute CSS Specificity Value:
CSS specificity determines the priority of which style rules are applied to an element. It is calculated using a weighted score based on the type of selectors used:

Inline styles: 1,0,0,0
ID selectors: 0,1,0,0
Class, attribute, and pseudo-class selectors: 0,0,1,0
Element and pseudo-element selectors: 0,0,0,1
Add up the values for each selector type in a rule to calculate its specificity. The rule with the highest specificity will be applied to the element.

- What are Box properties in CSS:
Box properties in CSS refer to a set of properties that control the layout and appearance of the rectangular "box" that surrounds every HTML element. These properties include:
Margin: The space outside the border of the element, between the element and its surrounding elements.
Border: The line that surrounds the element, between the padding and margin.
Padding: The space between the content of the element and its border.
Width and Height: The dimensions of the content area of the element.

- How does the browser load a webpage:
When a browser loads a webpage, it performs the following steps:

1. Fetch the HTML document: The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server to retrieve the HTML file.

2. Parse the HTML: The browser reads and parses the HTML code to build a structure called the Document Object Model (DOM).

3. Fetch additional resources: The browser fetches any linked resources, such as CSS files, JavaScript files, and images.

4. Apply CSS styles: The browser applies the CSS styles to the DOM according to the specificity rules and creates a Render Tree.

5. JavaScript execution: The browser executes any JavaScript code in the document, which may manipulate the DOM, modify CSS styles, or perform other actions.

6. Layout: The browser calculates the exact positions and dimensions of each element on the page based on the Render Tree and the CSS box model properties.

7. Painting: The browser draws the elements on the screen, using the layout information and styles.

8. Compositing: The browser combines different layers, such as text, images, and other visual elements, to create the final rendered page displayed to the user.

These steps can occur in parallel or iteratively, as the browser continuously updates the display to reflect changes in the DOM, CSS, or JavaScript.
